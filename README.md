## Introduction

This repository contains the codebase for a 10-page website dedicated to the Computer Science Department. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of my web development skills and showcase a comprehensive understanding of computer science resources. Leveraging the school's existing website as a foundation, I have undertaken the task of redesigning a more contemporary and user-friendly version.

## Beginning Project

To set up a local development environment or contribute to the project, follow these steps (from command palette):

1. Open the command palette with the key combination of Ctrl + Shift + P.

2. At the command palette prompt, enter git cl, select the Git: Clone command, then select Clone from GitHub and press Enter.

3. When prompted for the Repository URL, select clone from GitHub, then press Enter.

4. A prompt to sign into GitHub will appear, complete the sign-in process.

5. Select (or create) the local directory into which you want to clone the project

6. When you receive the notification asking if you want to open the cloned repository, select Open.

INITIALISATION (from activity bar) 7. Select source control from the activity bar, or use the key combination of Ctrl + Shift + G.

8. Select Initialize repository.

CREATE A BRANCH FOR CHANGES (from integrated terminal) 9. Open an integrated terminal from Terminal -> New Terminal.

10. Create a new branch named MY-BRANCH with the following git command:

11. 'git add --all' to add new files

12. 'git commit -m "message"' to commit changes

13. 'git push --set-upstream origin master' to push changes

## Conclusion

CHALLENGES AND KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. Working with Git.
   Challenge
   First git set up, creating repository, cloning, pushing and committing of project

Solution
It was essential for me to conduct an in-depth research on effectively building up a repository in order to overcome these obstacles. I took a methodical approach by making sure every commit had a valuable message and that modifications are committed on a frequent basis. I resolved issues as soon as they came up according to accepted Git best practices for efficient version management all during the development process.

2. Web Responsiveness Techniques
   Challenge
   Designing a website that adapts to different devices and screen sizes. This involves fluid grids, flexible images, and a navigation system to support all viewing experience.

3. Efficient use of Inheritance and Classes

4. The importance of Git committing in restoring older versions of a code.

5. Backup and Recovery Preparedness
   I've learnt to be prepared for unexpected data loss scenarios. Regularly perform data backups, automate backup processes, and maintain a documented disaster recovery plan for swift restoration in emergencies.
